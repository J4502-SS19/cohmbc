        <p>One day when I got back from school, I suddenly noticed my pet dog Lucky was missing. I went to tell Mum, but she just said that he would be OK because his name was Lucky. That just made me feel worse. I went to tell Dad, but he said the same thing.</p>
        <p>So I decided to go and look for him myself. I looked for him in the garden, but he wasn't there, so I looked in the paddocks where Mum and I had taken him for his walks. Then I went into the back yard to let the other dogs out of their kennels to look for him. I thought they might be able to help me find him, but I couldn't even find him with the other dog's help.</p>
        <p>So I gave up and put the other dogs back in their kennels, it was getting dark anyway. I had my dinner and went to bed. In the middle of the night I heard something scratching on my bedroom door. I got up and turned on the light, and what did I see? I saw Lucky! I let him into my bedroom and I hugged him and I patted him.</p>

        <p>My dog likes to swim and he catches fish to eat. When I whistle, he never obeys and he always goes the other way.</p>
        <p>	Well, you see the puppy is only small and not very clever and when he saw the lobster he thought I might be able to make a friend, so he tried to lick the lobster as if to say hello I like you but little did he know that the lobster would shake his hand in such a funny way that it made him toss back his head and bark with laughter!</p>

    <p>Luke, we're ready for takeoff. Good luck, Lando When we find Jabba the Hut and that bounty hunter, we'll contact you. I'll meet you at the rendezvous point on Tatooine. Princess, we'll find Han. I promise. Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal. Take care, you two. May the Force be with you. Ow!</p>

    <p>Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless!</p>

    <p>No, Threepio's with them. Just hang on. We're almost there. Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh - Take this off! I, uh, don't mean to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no...Please don't get up. No! Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the others. Oh, no! I've been shot!</p>
